"# GRS_POI" 

In this work I am developing a Points of Interest Recommendation System (POI) for Groups. Points of Interest can be bars, restaurants, museums, parks, monuments, places of tourist attractions in the city, beaches, events, etc.
Such recommendations are based on the preferences of the user groups and their geographic location, so the main objective is to recommend POIs that are geographically closer to the group that serve their interests simultaneously.
